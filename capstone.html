        <h2>May 5th</h2>
        <p>
            I went to training for the summer camp today. I had to wake up at 6:30 am and drive all the way to the UBC
            campus. The first thing we learned about was dealing with kids with exceptionalities. So, kids who have
            either learning disabilities, or other disabilities like hearing or sight. Later, we were put into groups
            and make a skit about what to do if there is an earthquake during the camp. After this, we were told that we
            had to create our own activity during our time at the science camp. I planned out a little workshop where I
            would lead the kids through making a simple random 8-ball fortune teller. I was going to do this on the last
            day of the science camp. We went over some scenarios of what could happen, and how to deal with those
            situations. I plan to make sure I practice the coding workshop, so I don’t mess up during the presentation.
            I will also review the instructor manual to make sure I know everything.

        <h2>June 2nd</h2>

        It was the first day of the camp today. We had to be at the school 2 hours before all the kids showed up. We
        went over the shape of the day, and whether any of the kids coming had any exceptionalities. There were some. I
        helped the teachers cut up some pipe cleaners for the first activity. Which was growing salt crystals. I was
        mostly with one group that needed the most help. The other 3 volunteers who were with me were very nice. The
        four of us also had to prepare a workshop with the kids together. We would do this on Thursday. We haven’t
        decided what we will do yet. The day went by simply. We were told today would be a “chill” day, as we would just
        be getting to know the kids and getting them comfortable with us. The kids were all being nice, there were a
        couple that I thought would be trouble. They all had to log in to some computers and follow an interactive
        tutorial about volcanoes at the end of the day. I helped a lot of the kids with that.

        <h2>June 3rd</h2>

        Second day was more stressful. Like yesterday I helped the instructors with setup for the activities we would do
        today. The first activity was about colors. We made a color wheel which would turn white when we spun it really
        fast. We were told to be extra careful to make sure the kids don’t hurt themselves with the scissors. At recess
        I was supervising kids on the playground. Once back inside, the kids made refrigerators with tinfoil, paper,
        Styrofoam and felt cloth. They had to put an ice cube inside and try to keep it as ice for as long as possible.
        As usual, I hovered around the class and helped those who asked for help and tried to give inspiration to those
        were not doing anything. Then it was lunch time. I played basketball with the kids from the older. There was a
        problem with some kids feeling left out. So I decided to remake the teams. Since I was taller and older than the
        kids there, I was at a very large advantage. I took the kids who were feeling left out and made sure they were
        playing while on my team. Everyone had way more fun this way. Once back inside, the kids continued with their
        refrigerators. I took my 30 minutes break here, I practiced my workshop I was going to present in a couple of
        days. Then when it was time to go home, I helped empty the kid’s refrigerators and made sure their parents
        picked them up. Then did some cleanup with the instructors and went home.
