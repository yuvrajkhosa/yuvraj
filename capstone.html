        <h2>May 5th</h2>
        <p>
            I went to training for the summer camp today. I had to wake up at 6:30 am and drive all the way to the UBC
            campus. The first thing we learned about was dealing with kids with exceptionalities. So, kids who have
            either learning disabilities, or other disabilities like hearing or sight. Later, we were put into groups
            and make a skit about what to do if there is an earthquake during the camp. After this, we were told that we
            had to create our own activity during our time at the science camp. I planned out a little workshop where I
            would lead the kids through making a simple random 8-ball fortune teller. I was going to do this on the last
            day of the science camp. We went over some scenarios of what could happen, and how to deal with those
            situations. I plan to make sure I practice the coding workshop, so I don’t mess up during the presentation.
            I will also review the instructor manual to make sure I know everything.
        </p>
        <h2>June 2nd</h2>

        <p>
            It was the first day of the camp today. We had to be at the school 2 hours before all the kids showed up. We
            went over the shape of the day, and whether any of the kids coming had any exceptionalities. There were
            some. I
            helped the teachers cut up some pipe cleaners for the first activity. Which was growing salt crystals. I was
            mostly with one group that needed the most help. The other 3 volunteers who were with me were very nice. The
            four of us also had to prepare a workshop with the kids together. We would do this on Thursday. We haven’t
            decided what we will do yet. The day went by simply. We were told today would be a “chill” day, as we would
            just
            be getting to know the kids and getting them comfortable with us. The kids were all being nice, there were a
            couple that I thought would be trouble. They all had to log in to some computers and follow an interactive
            tutorial about volcanoes at the end of the day. I helped a lot of the kids with that.
        </p>

        <h2>June 3rd</h2>

        <p>
            Second day was more stressful. Like yesterday I helped the instructors with setup for the activities we
            would do
            today. The first activity was about colors. We made a color wheel which would turn white when we spun it
            really
            fast. We were told to be extra careful to make sure the kids don’t hurt themselves with the scissors. At
            recess
            I was supervising kids on the playground. Once back inside, the kids made refrigerators with tinfoil, paper,
            Styrofoam and felt cloth. They had to put an ice cube inside and try to keep it as ice for as long as
            possible.
            As usual, I hovered around the class and helped those who asked for help and tried to give inspiration to
            those
            were not doing anything. Then it was lunch time. I played basketball with the kids from the older. There was
            a
            problem with some kids feeling left out. So I decided to remake the teams. Since I was taller and older than
            the
            kids there, I was at a very large advantage. I took the kids who were feeling left out and made sure they
            were
            playing while on my team. Everyone had way more fun this way. Once back inside, the kids continued with
            their
            refrigerators. I took my 30 minutes break here, I practiced my workshop I was going to present in a couple
            of
            days. Then when it was time to go home, I helped empty the kid’s refrigerators and made sure their parents
            picked them up. Then did some cleanup with the instructors and went home.
        </p>

        <h2>June 4th</h2>

        <p>
            Third day, and tomorrow is my presentation. I worked on it a lot yesterday evening to make sure I could
            explain
            everything well and made sure that I had answers to some questions that might come up. I wrote down some
            notes
            on some things to keep in mind. The first activity was a zipline activity. The kids made little carriers
            that
            were to be put on a string and ziplined down on an incline. I handled the hot glue for the class, because
            the
            kids were too young to handle hot glue guns. At recess there were problems on the playground. One kid had an
            argument with another kid and sat on the swings the whole time and wouldn’t come back inside. I did what was
            written in the junior instructor manual and first told the teachers and followed their instructions. I tried
            my
            best to convince him to come back inside. It took a while, but in the end, I said we would play basketball,
            with
            just me and him on a team. That seemed to cheer him up and he came back inside. Inside, the class worked on
            their ziplines and finally tested them out on the string. I was holding up the zipline and was giving more
            suggestions on how they could improve on their carriers. Lunch went by smoothly, there weren’t any conflicts
            and
            I played basketball with the kid from earlier. Inside, the teachers chose to play a game with the kids. They
            asked me to lead it, so I chose to play hot potato. They had a lot of fun, and it was almost time to go
            home.
            The kids went home while a magic school bus show was running, and the class was empty in about 15 mins. I
            stayed
            back and helped clean up for 1 more hour before I went home.

                <b><u>What I presented</u></b>
            </a></h2>

        <p>
            Fourth day, and today was presentation day. When I went in for preparation of the day, I went over my
            presentation with the teachers. They said it was great. The kids came in on time and were given a riddle to
            keep them occupied while we checked in the rest of the kids. The kids were making model volcanoes with clay.
            We had pre-cut the clay in the morning into slices for the kids and encouraged them to be creative. I gave
            them a quick lesson on different types of volcanoes and the teachers gave the instructions. Most students
            took a similar approach of a pointy volcano, but some made a flatter shield volcano. Recess was the best it
            has ever been, there were no issues and I played basketball with the boys. Back inside, the kids finished
            off their volcanoes and we would erupt them after lunch. Lunch went by smoothly as well. Now it was time to
            erupt their volcanoes. We did it outside and it got messy. It took about 10 minutes. Now it was time for my
            presentation. I first started off by showing them the finished product and “read some of their fortunes”.
            They all seemed to love it and since they were 7 years old… they believed it. I got a lot of questions along
            the way about loops. Loops are blocks of code that repeat themselves with small iterations. I took some time
            to go through what loops and conditional statements were before continuing. I had the kids vote on the
            appearance of the project. They chose for a witch theme. Once it was finished one of the kids volunteered to
            ask a question. He asked, “Am I cool?”. I run the fortune teller, and of course, the universe chose “Of
            course not!”. The kid started crying, but I quickly told him I pressed the button wrong, so I did it again
            and he got “Yes”. The kids quickly learned not to ask questions about them selves if they didn’t want to get
            heart broken. They seemed to enjoy it and they all played with it for a while.
        </p>
        <h2>June 6th</h2>
        <p>
            Yesterday was my last day at camp. During the end of yesterday the whole staff and junior instructors sat in
            a circle and wrote down 3 people in and something they really noticed about them. That was a nice experience
            because it really felt like I was appreciated for my hard work. I don’t have any regrets of volunteering
            here but I wished I had kept more detailed notes on what I did throughout the day. At the end it became a
            bit of a blur because of how tired I was in the end. I was the only one playing sports with the kids and
            that also caused me to be fatigued. I hope to volunteer here next year as well. I plan do my capstone on
            this, and I think it will really help me find a job in software engineering.
