        <h1 class="subheading">Volunteerism</h1>

        <p>
            I have volunteered over 48 hours at UBC Geering UP science summer camp and UBC Let's Talk Tech. While I was
            at UBC's summer camp, I was part of a team of junior instructors whose job was
            to supervise children during work and play time, educating children on STEM topics, keeping children engaged
            during recess and lunch, and supporting those with exceptionalities.
            I had alot of experience with handling issues with the children, whether it being emotional, or physical on
            the playground. I also taught the kids some basic programming skills, like
            how to give computers specific instructions, variables, if/else statements, and loops. At the summer camp,
            there was coding mixed in with many other science activities and I had a blast
            helping the kids learn. At Let's Talk Talk, it was all coding. I really solidified my own understanding of
            coding and programming concepts. I was leading a group of kids that were more
            advanced than the rest, in regards to coding. I was working with them to make more complex projects. I
            helped give them guidance into how to solve certain problems and also taught them
            how to code with "text" instead of block based coding.

        <h1 class="subheading">Awards & Recognition</h1>

            I got excellence in Math, Science, French, English, Band and Jazz Band in grade 9. In grade 10 I for a 4.0
            GPA. I was part of the 2019 Surrey Junior-Senior REC Jazz band. 3rd place winner in Surrey Youth STEM
            innovation challenge.
            In 2017 my team and I got first place in the Surrey Science competition trivia challenge.

        <h1 class="subheading">Personal Interests</h1>

        <p>
            In my free time, I like talking to my friends, playing video games with friends, and also playing outside.
            My favorite sport is volleyball. I love playing the drums, especially in jazz. Ofcourse, I also love coding,
            and software design in general.
            I want to become a software engineer, and this is my passion.
