        <p>
            I have volunteered over 48 hours at UBC Geering UP science summer camp and UBC Let's Talk Tech. While I was
            at UBC's summer camp, I was part of a team of junior instructors whose job was
            to supervise children during work and play time, educating children on STEM topics, keeping children engaged
            during recess and lunch, and supporting those with exceptionalities.
            I had alot of experience with handling issues with the children, whether it being emotional, or physical on
            the playground. I also taught the kids some basic programming skills, like
            how to give computers specific instructions, variables, if/else statements, and loops. At the summer camp,
            there was coding mixed in with many other science activities and I had a blast
            helping the kids learn. At Let's Talk Talk, it was all coding. I really solidified my own understanding of
            coding and programming concepts. I was leading a group of kids that were more
            advanced than the rest, in regards to coding. I was working with them to make more complex projects. I
            helped give them guidance into how to solve certain problems and also taught them
            how to code with "text" instead of block based coding.
